At the same time, this is one of the factor that make people loose interest. They prefer follow the news from outside this country.

   Six motivation - Based shopping orientations of shoppers

   - Chameleons: Shopping styles are situation specific or constantly changing. Their shopping approach is based on product type, shopping impetus, and purchase task.

   - Collectors/Gathers: Stockpile items and to purchase large quantities to either save money or alleviate the need for shopping. They attempt to get the best price and take advantage of retailer guarantees.

Shoppers agreed that they sometimes had a hard time finding products that they wanted to buy and then  proceed to leave the store without making any purchase. This is the same as the national survey commissioned by Aisle411 where they said that 20% of shoppers have departed a store without fulfilling their purchase intent, and 84% have had difficulty finding products on the crowded shelves of retailers.

- ### b. Requirements

  Describe necessary capabilities of the product (Define requirement)

  1. Functional and data needs

     (user's information, why user need this)

     - Data requirements :

      Personas' data needs are the objects and information that must be represented in the
      system. Using the semantics just described, it is often useful to think of data requirements
      as the objects and adjectives related to those objects. Common examples include
      accounts, people, addresses, documents, messages, songs, and images, as well as attributes
      of those, such as status, dates, size, creator, and subject.
     Functional requirements :

     - Functional needs are the operations or actions that need to be performed on the system's
        objects and that typically are translated into interface controls. These can be thought of
        as the product's actions. Functional needs also define places or containers where objects
        or information in the interface must be displayed. (These clearly are not actions in and of
        themselves but usually are suggested by actions.)

  - user mental models
  - design imperatives
  - product vision
  - business requirements / Business requirements can include stakeholder priorities, development timelines,
    budgetary and resource constraints, regulations and legal considerations, pricing
    structures, and business models.
