   In past few years, Malaysian football fans would not be able to get info and news easily. Even though, the technology has arise in this new era. They only get all the info from certain sources. For examples, newspapers, television, and etc. According to survey commissioned by Football Association Malaysia (FAM), we found out that 70% out of all the football lovers in Malaysia missed the progress about Malaysia football scene. At the same time, this is one of the factor that make people loose interest. They prefer follow the news from outside this country.
